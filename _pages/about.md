My name is Vidhan Kashyap, and I am a master’s student at Osaka University in Osaka, conducting research under the guidance of Prof. Masahiko Shibahara and Prof. Kunio Fujiwara. I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, in 2021.

My research focuses on simulating nucleate boiling using advanced hybrid computational models. By combining Molecular Dynamics to analyze microscopic behavior near surfaces and continuum-scale Navier–Stokes equations to model larger fluid flow, I aim to better understand phase-change processes essential for energy systems and thermal management.

Outside the lab, I enjoy competitive programming, honing my problem-solving skills through algorithmic challenges. I’m an avid reader of novels, a nature enthusiast who loves hiking, and a photography hobbyist capturing life’s candid moments. I’m also passionate about watching and playing cricket, chess, solving Rubik’s cubes (pushing for a sub-1-minute solve!), and exploring fractal mathematics. To balance it all, I enjoy midday naps that recharge my creativity. Currently, I’m preparing for the N3 level of the Japanese language, immersing myself in its nuances and sharing my journey on my blog. You can find me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/vidhankashyap/) and check out my blog for the latter!
