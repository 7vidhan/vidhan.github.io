My name is Vidhan Kashyap, and I am a master’s student at the Osaka University at Osaka. I earned my bachelors in Mechanical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur in 2021. 

My research involves hybrid atomistic–continuum computational models to simulate nucleate boiling, integrating Molecular Dynamics for near-wall phenomena with continuum-scale Navier–Stokes equations to explore phase-change processes. 

I enjoy reading novels, hiking, photography, and indulging in the occasional midday naps to recharge. Beyond academics, I am passionate about chess, solving Rubik’s cubes (targeting a sub-1-minute solve), fractal mathematics and studying Japanese, where I am preparing for the N3 level. You can find me doing the former on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/vidhankashyap/) and check out my blog for the latter!
