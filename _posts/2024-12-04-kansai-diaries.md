#### Getting lost and loving it: My travel tales!

## Kansai Adventures: Kobe, Wakayama, and Beyond

Kansai is a treasure trove of experiences, and Kobe holds a special place in my heart. Why? Because it has everything. Mountains? Check. Sea? Check. Chinatown? Onsen? City life? Islands? You name it, Kobe’s got it. It’s the perfect blend of nature and urban charm, making every visit feel like an adventure.

### A Snowy Quest to Koyasan

Wakayama, on the other hand, breathes a completely different vibe. If I had to sum it up, it’s natural beauty meets rich culture. It’s serene, unspoiled, and feels like a slice of old Japan. And let’s talk about the mikan—those delicious, juicy oranges that are an absolute must-try. Forget souvenirs; you’ll want to take home a crate of these!

For the hiking enthusiast in me, Koyasan was a dream. The hike? A marathon-worthy 24 km trek that took a solid 7–8 hours. The goal? To find snow amidst the serene mountain paths. While it was long and challenging, every step felt like a conquest through stunning landscapes, with the crisp mountain air keeping me energized.

### Off the Beaten Path

While not in Kansai, I couldn’t resist making a little side trip to Shimada in Shizuoka. There’s something uniquely special about every low-key town in Japan, and Shimada proved that perfectly. We explored a quaint zoo and a biological park, which made for a calming and refreshing day. It wasn’t just about the sights—the vibe was so relaxing, and I even got some great clicks to cherish.

Life’s all about going the extra mile, right? Shimada may not have been part of the original plan, but it was totally worth the detour.
